**Description**

Project 3: Spots consists of starting the construction of a social media platform where users can post images and like the images of others. In this project, multiple hover effects are used to make the user experience better. Additionally, this site is usable on any devices wider than 320px due to the responsive web design that has been implemented. The responsive web design is capable because of the flexbox and grid layout that were used. Spots was designed using HTML and CSS through VSCode.
